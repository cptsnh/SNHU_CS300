## Project description
The purpose of this project is to provide pseudocode, algorithm analysis, and completed code for a course planner that we are going to design for ABC University (ABCU). The pseudocode will consist of functions that pertain to file parsing, creating objects and storing them in a data structure, searching the data structure, and printing the data. I also provide pseudocode for the main menu of the application. The main menu will include options for loading data in the data structure, printing the entire course list, printing information on individual courses, and exiting the application. The course planner is completed using C++, uses the binary search tree to perform the operations listed in the menu.

The main object used in the assignment is a Course class. Each course will contain a string value for its id, a string value for its title, and a vector to store prerequisite courses for the given Course object. In this scenario, the CourseId will be used as the key for the object. I use a vector to store prerequisites because a course can have more than one prerequisite and a vector is suitable for dynamic insertion. The tree data structure is built using objects called Nodes, which store the course object and pointers to children nodes.
